To use the application, run the index.php file in the browser. You don't need a server for it. It's an application that you can
use to remind you of what you have to do on any day(s) you chose. It has a calender feature for that to happen. If the task
expires, it will have a red background. If you complete it, by clicking the button, then the background will turn green. If
you don't want to use that, then you can delete tasks.
